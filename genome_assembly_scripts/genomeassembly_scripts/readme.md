Scripts for genome assembly

1. Run hifiasm
2. Use assemblathon to get summary stats
3. Map HiC reads to assemblies using BWS
4. Convert BAM to SAM with SAMtools
5. QC HiC reads
6. Index SAM files
7. Scaffold assembly with YAHs
8. Index scaffolds with SAMtools
9. Prep YAHS files for running juicer (Yahs juicer pre)
10. Run Juicer to visualize HiC contact map â€” use GUI to visualize output
11. Run YAHS to incorporate changes made to assembly in last step
12. Run BUSCO on final assembly to see genome completeness
13. Run FCS to screen and clean genome of contaminant from other organisms
